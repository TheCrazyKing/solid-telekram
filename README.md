Telegram client for KaiOS.

### Made with

## Additional Info

- First launch of the app will take a while (idk why), the next app launches will not take so long.
- Currently Forum Groups will act as "View as Messages" as in the Telegram Web K client.
- pre-optimized lottie stickers are pre-converted apng images so client side rendering is not an issue, those stickers can be found in [kaigram-assets](https://github.com/cyan-2048/kaigram-assets)
- using this app on a 256MB RAM KaiOS device is kinda unstable.

## Developing

Please create a `.env.local` file and add the values in `.env` replacing the APP_ID and APP_HASH with your own.

Dev Mode:

```
bun run dev
```

Build:

```
bun run build
```

add the `:v3` suffix for KaiOS 3.0 (example: `bun run dev:v3`)

## Technical Info

- For KaiOS 2.5, the app utilizes _real_ asm.js and on KaiOS 3.0 it uses WebAssembly like normal.
- mtcute is modified to use big-integer, this means BigInt can be used in KaiOS 2.5 and native BigInts are used for KaiOS 3.0.
- mtcute is also modified in order for asm.js to be used.
- there are 3 Web Workers
  - mtcute web worker proxy
  - heavy tasks worker for blocking operations (webp to png, md5, etc.)
  - (not yet implemented) rlottie
- SystemJS is used to simulate esm modules on KaiOS 2.5, it is also used to import asm.js files in order for it to preserve asm.js syntax.
